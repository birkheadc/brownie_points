## Brownie Points

A game for partners where you fight over brownie points by doing favors for each other.

# The Game

Brownie Points is a game for two to play. The game takes place over rounds that last a week. At the end of the week, the winner is chosen semi-randomly based on who has more points; the larger the gap, the higher your chance of winning. Victory is never guarunteed, so every point counts!

The winner recieves a pre-determined Victory Favor from the loser, and then points are rebalanced. Points don't reset entirely, so don't give up on a week just because you don't care about this week's Victory Favor; you'll need those points eventually!

Points are exchanged // Todo

# The Code

Built with Ruby on Rails. Rails might not be the best choice for this project, but I chose it anyway to practice it.

The game client is just a standard web page; the 'game' all occurs outside in real life, the application just keeps track of points.

Ruby Version: 3.1.2p20
Rails Version: 7.0.4
